# reveal.js Solo

An example of a reveal.js presentation that can be shared in one file. All JavaScript and CSS files
are loaded from a CDN. To share the presentation, just send or link to the index.html file. To view
the presentation, just open index.html in a web browser on a device that is connected to the
Internet.

You can serve this presentation from any static web server, or as this project is doing, from GitHub
Pages (see it [here](https://tpanning.github.com/revealjs-solo/)). To serve via GitHub Pages, fork
this repository and make sure all commits are going to the gh-pages branch (this repository has
gh-pages as the only branch, so if you fork it you shouldn't have to do anything).
